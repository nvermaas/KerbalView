# KerbalView
The KerbalView project is a technology demonstrator to try out various web technologies in a fun way. The starting point is a user (me) playing a game of Kerbal Space Program on a Windows laptop. Information from that gameplay is presented (live) in a browser that connects to my Apache2 webserver that runs on a Linux Mint box.

The documentation is on a (private) wiki, but this is a pdf file that shows most of it:
